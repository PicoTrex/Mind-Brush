The 2025 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2024–25 season and conclusion to the season's playoffs. The best-of-seven series ended with the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder defeating the Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers in seven games. The Thunder's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was voted the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). The series began on June 5 and ended on June 22 with the first NBA Finals Game 7 since 2016.[1]
With a league-best regular season record of 68–14, the Thunder held home-court advantage in the Finals. They came into the series as heavy favorites against the 50–32 Pacers.[2] The Pacers set an NBA postseason record with five 15-point comebacks.[3] One such rally was in Game 1 of the Finals, when Tyrese Haliburton made a game-winning two-point jumpshot. The two teams would end up with three wins each, requiring a decisive Game 7, in which Haliburton tore his right Achilles tendon in the first quarter.[4] The Thunder's victory secured their second championship in franchise history, after their 1979 title as the Seattle SuperSonics, and their first since their 2008 move to Oklahoma City.
The 2025 Finals crowned the NBA's seventh unique champion in seven years, the longest stretch in league history.[5] The 2025 Finals was also the first since 2006 in which both cities were seeking their first NBA championship.[a][7]
Background[edit]
General[edit]
This was the first playoff match-up between Oklahoma City and Indiana. Oklahoma City won both of its regular season games against Indiana.[8] The Thunder had not lost a game at home to an Eastern Conference team since losing to the Pacers on March 12, 2024.[9] Both teams were in the Finals after missing the playoffs two seasons prior.[10] This was the smallest NBA Finals in terms of total market size, with the previous lowest mark belonging to Cleveland and San Antonio in 2007.[11] The total television market size comprises fewer than two million households with Indianapolis being the 22nd largest and Oklahoma City being the 26th largest out of 28 markets league-wide.[12] The 2025 Finals also set another milestone; it was the first Finals without a luxury tax team since the salary cap era began in 2002.[13]
Coincidentally, both teams traded former star player Paul George in trades that yielded their current best players, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton to the Thunder and the Pacers, respectively.[14][15][16] On the eve of free agency in 2017, the Pacers traded George to the Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis...
